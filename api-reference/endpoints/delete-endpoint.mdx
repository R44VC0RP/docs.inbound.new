## Examples

### Delete Webhook Endpoint

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE "https://inbound.new/api/v2/endpoints/ep_abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://inbound.new/api/v2/endpoints/ep_abc123', {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}`
  }
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(`Deleted endpoint: ${result.message}`);
console.log(`Cleanup: ${result.cleanup.emailAddressesUpdated} email addresses updated`);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.delete(
    'https://inbound.new/api/v2/endpoints/ep_abc123',
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}
)

result = response.json()
print(f"Deleted endpoint: {result['message']}")
print(f"Cleanup: {result['cleanup']['emailAddressesUpdated']} email addresses updated")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Delete Email Group Endpoint

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE "https://inbound.new/api/v2/endpoints/ep_def456" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"

## What Happens During Deletion

<Steps>
  <Step title="Email Address Cleanup">
    All email addresses that route to this endpoint are updated to "store only" mode. They will continue to receive emails but won't be forwarded or sent to webhooks.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Domain Catch-All Updates">
    Any domains using this endpoint for catch-all routing will have their catch-all configuration removed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Email Group Cleanup">
    If this is an email group endpoint, all email addresses in the group are deleted from the group table.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delivery History Cleanup">
    All delivery history records associated with this endpoint are permanently deleted.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Endpoint Deletion">
    Finally, the endpoint itself is deleted from the system.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Important Considerations

<Warning>
**This action cannot be undone.** Once an endpoint is deleted, all its configuration and delivery history are permanently lost.
</Warning>

<Note>
Email addresses affected by the deletion will continue to receive emails in "store only" mode. You can later configure them to route to a different endpoint.
</Note>

<Tip>
Before deleting an endpoint, consider disabling it first using the update endpoint to test the impact on your email routing.
</Tip>

## Impact on Email Routing

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Email Addresses" icon="envelope">
    Emails will be stored but not forwarded or sent to webhooks
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Catch-All Domains" icon="globe">
    Unknown emails to these domains will be stored but not routed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best Practices

### Before Deletion
1. **Review dependencies** - Check which email addresses and domains use this endpoint
2. **Test impact** - Disable the endpoint first to see the impact
3. **Backup configuration** - Save endpoint configuration if you might need to recreate it
4. **Plan migration** - Set up replacement endpoints for affected email addresses

### After Deletion
1. **Update email addresses** - Configure affected email addresses to route to new endpoints
2. **Update catch-all domains** - Configure new catch-all endpoints for affected domains
3. **Monitor email flow** - Ensure emails are being routed correctly to new endpoints
4. **Clean up unused resources** - Remove any other resources that depended on this endpoint

## Cleanup Response Breakdown

The cleanup response helps you understand what was affected:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Email Addresses">
    Shows which email addresses were set to "store only" mode and need to be reconfigured with new endpoints.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Domains">
    Shows which domains had their catch-all routing disabled and need new catch-all endpoints configured.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Group Emails">
    For email group endpoints, shows how many individual email addresses were removed from the group.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Delivery History">
    Shows how many delivery records were deleted. This affects analytics and reporting.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

    Use the update email address endpoint to point affected addresses to new endpoints.
  </Accordion>
