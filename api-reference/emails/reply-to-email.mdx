## Email Threading

This endpoint automatically handles email threading by:

1. **Setting the In-Reply-To header** with the Message-ID of the original email
2. **Building the References header** to maintain the full conversation thread
3. **Formatting the subject** with "Re: " prefix if not already present
4. **Quoting the original message** (when `include_original` is true) with proper attribution

<Info>
Email clients like Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail will recognize these threading headers and group the emails into a conversation.

## Idempotency

This endpoint supports idempotency to prevent duplicate sends. Include an `Idempotency-Key` header with a unique value:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://inbound.new/api/v2/emails/email_abc123/reply \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: unique-key-123" \
  -d '{...}'
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch('https://inbound.new/api/v2/emails/email_abc123/reply', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Idempotency-Key': 'unique-key-123'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({...})
});
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
If you make multiple requests with the same idempotency key, only the first request will send an email. Subsequent requests will return the same response without sending a duplicate.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify sender domain">
  Always ensure the `from` domain is verified in your account before attempting to send replies.
</Step>

<Step title="Include both text and HTML">
  For best compatibility, include both `text` and `html` versions of your email content.
</Step>

<Step title="Use idempotency keys">
  When sending replies programmatically, use idempotency keys to prevent accidental duplicate sends.
</Step>

<Step title="Handle quoted content carefully">
  Consider whether including the original message is appropriate for your use case. Automated responses might not need it.
</Step>

<Step title="Test threading">
  Test your replies with various email clients to ensure threading works as expected.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Rate Limits

Reply sending is subject to the same rate limits as the [Send Email](/api-reference/emails/send-email) endpoint. Your plan determines how many emails you can send per month.
