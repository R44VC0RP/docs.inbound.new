title: "Create Domain"
api: "POST /api/v2/domains"
description: "Add a new domain for email receiving with automatic DNS and SES verification setup"
---

## Overview

This endpoint adds a new domain to your account for email receiving. It performs DNS validation, checks domain limits, and initiates AWS SES verification automatically.

<Warning>
The domain must not have existing MX or CNAME records that would conflict with email receiving. The endpoint will check for these conflicts before creating the domain.
</Warning>

## Domain Verification Process

After creating a domain, you'll need to complete the verification process:

<Steps>
<Step title="Add DNS Records">
  Add the DNS records returned in the `dnsRecords` array to your domain's DNS configuration. This includes:
  
  - **TXT record** for SES domain verification (required)
  - **MX record** for email routing (required)  
  - **SPF record** for email authentication (recommended)
  - **DMARC record** for email policy (recommended)
  
  <Tip>
  The exact method depends on your DNS provider. Most providers have a DNS management interface where you can add TXT and MX records. While SPF and DMARC records are not required for basic functionality, they significantly improve email deliverability.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Wait for Propagation">
  DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate, but typically complete within 1-2 hours.
  
  <Info>
  You can check the current verification status using the GET endpoint with `check=true` parameter.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Verification Complete">
  Once all DNS records are verified, the domain status will automatically update to `verified` and you can start receiving emails.
  
  <Check>
  Verified domains can receive emails and have catch-all forwarding configured.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Important Notes

<Info>
Domain creation includes automatic checks for plan limits using the billing system. If you've reached your domain limit, you'll need to upgrade your plan.
</Info>

<Warning>
The domain must not have existing MX or CNAME records that would conflict with email receiving. Remove any existing email routing before adding the domain.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Use descriptive domain names and ensure you have admin access to the DNS configuration before adding a domain.
</Tip>

## Related Endpoints

After creating a domain, you might want to:
- **Check verification status**: Use `GET /api/v2/domains/{id}?check=true`
- **Configure catch-all**: Use `PUT /api/v2/domains/{id}`
- **View DNS records**: Use `GET /api/v2/domains/{id}/dns-records`

## Notes

- Domain verification is initiated automatically upon creation
- The `dnsRecords` array contains all 4 records needed for complete verification and optimal deliverability
- 2 records (TXT and MX) are required for basic functionality
- 2 additional records (SPF and DMARC) are recommended for enhanced email authentication
- Domain limits are checked against your current plan before creation
- Provider detection helps identify the DNS service for better user guidance
- All domains start in `pending` status until required DNS records are verified
