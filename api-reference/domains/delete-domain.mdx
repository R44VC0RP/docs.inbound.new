## Deletion Process

The domain deletion process follows these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Validate Domain Ownership">
  Verify that the domain exists and belongs to the authenticated user.
</Step>

<Step title="Remove AWS SES Receipt Rules">
  Delete both catch-all and individual email receipt rules from AWS SES.
  
  <Info>
  This prevents any new emails from being processed for this domain.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Delete AWS SES Identity">
  Remove the domain identity from AWS SES to complete the AWS cleanup.
  
  <Warning>
  This step is irreversible and will immediately stop email receiving for the domain.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Clean Up Database Records">
  Delete all associated records in the following order:
  - Blocked emails
  - Email addresses
  - DNS records
  - Domain record
  
  <Check>
  All data is permanently removed from the database.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Important Notes

<Warning>
Domain deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. All emails, addresses, and configuration will be lost.
</Warning>

<Info>
If AWS SES operations fail, the domain will still be deleted from the database. You may need to manually clean up AWS resources if needed.
</Info>

<Tip>
Before deleting a domain, consider downloading any important emails or exporting configuration if you need to recreate the domain later.
</Tip>

## What Gets Deleted

When you delete a domain, the following resources are permanently removed:

### Email Resources
- All email addresses configured for the domain
- All received emails stored for the domain
- All blocked email entries for the domain

### DNS Configuration
- All DNS records required for domain verification
- Verification status and history

### AWS SES Configuration
- Domain identity in AWS SES
- All receipt rules (catch-all and individual email rules)
- SES verification tokens and status

### Domain Settings
- Catch-all configuration
- Domain verification status
- Provider detection information
- All timestamps and metadata

## After Deletion

After successfully deleting a domain:

- The domain can be re-added as a new domain (it will go through verification again)
- AWS SES resources are cleaned up and billing should stop
- All email receiving for the domain stops immediately
- DNS records in your DNS provider remain (you may want to remove them manually)

## Related Actions

Before deleting a domain, you might want to:
- **Export data**: Download emails or configuration
- **Update forwarding**: Redirect emails to other domains
- **Check usage**: Review email statistics or recent activity

## Notes

- Domain deletion affects all users who have access to the domain
- AWS SES cleanup is attempted but may not always succeed (this doesn't prevent domain deletion)
- DNS records in your DNS provider are not automatically removed
- The domain can be re-added later, but all configuration will need to be set up again
- Billing for the domain stops immediately after deletion
