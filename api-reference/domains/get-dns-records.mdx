## DNS Record Types

The following DNS record types are commonly used for domain verification:

### TXT Records
Used for domain verification and AWS SES identity verification.

<CodeGroup>
```dns TXT Record Example
Name: _amazonses.example.com
Value: abc123def456ghi789jkl
```
</CodeGroup>

### MX Records
Used to route emails to the correct mail servers.

<CodeGroup>
```dns MX Record Example
Name: example.com
Value: 10 inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Priority: 10
```
</CodeGroup>

### SPF Records (TXT)
Used for email authentication to specify which servers can send emails on behalf of your domain.

<CodeGroup>
```dns SPF Record Example
Name: example.com
Value: v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
SPF records help prevent email spoofing by specifying authorized mail servers. The `~all` indicates a "soft fail" for unauthorized servers, while `-all` would be a "hard fail".
</Info>

### DMARC Records (TXT)
Used for email authentication policy to specify how receiving servers should handle emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks.

<CodeGroup>
```dns DMARC Record Example
Name: _dmarc.example.com
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com; ruf=mailto:dmarc@example.com; fo=1; aspf=r; adkim=r
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
DMARC records provide reporting and policy instructions. The `p=none` policy is recommended for monitoring, while `p=quarantine` or `p=reject` provide stronger protection once you've verified your email authentication setup.
</Info>

### CNAME Records
Sometimes used for specific subdomain configurations.

<CodeGroup>
```dns CNAME Record Example
Name: mail.example.com
Value: inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```
</CodeGroup>

## Verification Status

Each DNS record has a verification status that indicates whether it's properly configured:

<Steps>
<Step title="Not Verified (isVerified: false)">
  The DNS record has not been verified yet or is incorrectly configured.
  
  <Warning>
  Check that the record has been added to your DNS provider with the exact name and value.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Verified (isVerified: true)">
  The DNS record has been verified and is correctly configured.
  
  <Check>
  This record is properly set up and contributing to domain verification.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common DNS Configuration

Here's how to configure the most common DNS records:

### Adding TXT Records
1. Log into your DNS provider (Cloudflare, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. Navigate to DNS management
3. Add a new TXT record with the exact name and value provided
4. Save the changes

### Adding MX Records
1. Remove any existing MX records for the domain
2. Add the new MX record with the provided hostname and priority
3. Ensure no conflicting MX records exist

## Important Notes

<Info>
DNS propagation can take up to 24 hours, but typically completes within 1-2 hours. Check the `lastChecked` timestamp to see when verification was last attempted.
</Info>

<Tip>
Use the domain's GET endpoint with `check=true` to trigger a real-time verification check of all DNS records.
</Tip>

<Warning>
All required DNS records must be verified before the domain can receive emails. Missing or incorrect records will prevent email delivery.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

If DNS records are not verifying:

1. **Check DNS propagation**: Use online DNS lookup tools to verify records are visible
2. **Verify exact values**: Ensure the name and value match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. **Remove conflicting records**: Delete any existing MX or CNAME records that might conflict
4. **Wait for propagation**: DNS changes can take time to propagate globally

## Related Endpoints

- **Trigger verification check**: `GET /api/v2/domains/{id}?check=true`
- **View domain status**: `GET /api/v2/domains/{id}`
- **List all domains**: `GET /api/v2/domains`

## Notes

- DNS records are automatically created when a domain is added
- The `isVerified` status is updated during verification checks
- All required records must be verified for the domain to become active
- DNS records are automatically deleted when a domain is removed
- Record verification happens automatically but can be triggered manually
