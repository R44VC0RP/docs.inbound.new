## Important Notes

<Info>
Email addresses are automatically configured with AWS SES receipt rules upon creation. This enables immediate email receiving capability.
</Info>

<Warning>
You can specify either an `endpointId` or `webhookId` for routing, but not both. If neither is provided, emails will not be forwarded anywhere.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Make sure your endpoint or webhook is active and properly configured before creating the email address to ensure emails are delivered successfully.
</Tip>

## Email Routing Options

### Endpoint Routing
Routes emails to a configured endpoint (webhook, email forwarding, etc.)
- More flexible routing options
- Can include additional configuration
- Managed through the endpoints API

### Webhook Routing  
Routes emails directly to a webhook URL
- Simple webhook-based routing
- Direct HTTP POST to specified URL
- Managed through the webhooks API

### No Routing
Email addresses without routing will receive emails but won't forward them anywhere
- Useful for testing or temporary addresses
- Emails are stored but not forwarded

## Related Endpoints

After creating an email address, you might want to:
- **Update routing**: Use `PUT /api/v2/email-addresses/{id}`
- **Check status**: Use `GET /api/v2/email-addresses/{id}`
- **List all addresses**: Use `GET /api/v2/email-addresses`

## Notes

- Email addresses require a verified domain to function
- AWS SES receipt rules are automatically created and managed
- Email addresses can be created with or without routing configuration
- The domain must be in `verified` status before email addresses can receive emails
- Only one routing method (endpoint or webhook) can be used per email address
