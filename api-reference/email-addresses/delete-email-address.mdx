## Deletion Process

The email address deletion follows these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Validate Ownership">
  Verify that the email address exists and belongs to the authenticated user.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Domain Context">
  Identify other active email addresses on the same domain to determine SES rule updates needed.
  
  <Info>
  This ensures proper SES rule management for remaining email addresses.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Delete Email Address">
  Remove the email address record from the database.
  
  <Warning>
  This step is irreversible - the email address configuration is permanently lost.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Update SES Rules">
  Update AWS SES receipt rules based on remaining email addresses:
  - If other addresses exist: Update rule to exclude deleted address
  - If no addresses remain: Remove the entire SES rule for the domain
  
  <Check>
  This ensures proper email routing for remaining addresses and cleanup when none remain.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## SES Rule Management

### Multiple Email Addresses on Domain
When other email addresses exist on the same domain:
- The SES receipt rule is updated to remove the deleted address
- Other email addresses continue to function normally
- The domain's SES configuration remains intact

### Last Email Address on Domain
When deleting the last email address on a domain:
- The entire SES receipt rule for the domain is removed
- The domain can still receive catch-all emails if configured
- Individual email routing for that domain stops completely

## Important Notes

<Info>
Email address deletion automatically manages AWS SES receipt rules to ensure proper email routing for remaining addresses.
</Info>

<Warning>
Deleting an email address is permanent. The address cannot be recovered, though it can be recreated as a new address.
</Warning>

<Tip>
If you encounter SES cleanup warnings, the email address is still deleted from the database, but you may need to manually clean up AWS SES rules.
</Tip>

## Impact on Email Delivery

### Before Deletion
- Emails to the address are received and forwarded according to routing configuration
- SES receipt rules include this address in their configuration

### After Deletion
- Emails to the deleted address are no longer received
- SES receipt rules are updated to exclude this address
- Other email addresses on the domain continue to function normally

## AWS SES Integration

The deletion process handles SES integration automatically:

### Successful SES Updates
- `sesRuleUpdated: true` indicates successful AWS SES cleanup
- Email routing is properly updated for remaining addresses
- No manual intervention required

### Failed SES Updates  
- `sesRuleUpdated: false` with warning message
- Email address still deleted from database
- Manual SES rule cleanup may be required
- Common causes: AWS configuration issues, permissions problems

## Related Actions

Before deleting an email address, you might want to:
- **Check current configuration**: `GET /api/v2/email-addresses/{id}`
- **Update routing temporarily**: `PUT /api/v2/email-addresses/{id}`
- **List other addresses on domain**: `GET /api/v2/email-addresses?domainId={domainId}`

After deletion, you can:
- **Recreate the address**: `POST /api/v2/email-addresses`
- **Check domain status**: `GET /api/v2/domains/{domainId}`
- **Review remaining addresses**: `GET /api/v2/email-addresses`

## Notes

- Email address deletion affects AWS SES receipt rules automatically
- Other email addresses on the same domain continue to function
- The domain itself remains unaffected by individual email address deletion
- Deleted email addresses can be recreated with the same address
- SES rule management ensures no interruption to other email addresses on the domain
