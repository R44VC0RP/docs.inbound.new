## Understanding the Response

### Routing Types

The `routing.type` field indicates how emails are processed:

<Steps>
<Step title="Endpoint Routing (routing.type: 'endpoint')">
  Emails are routed through a configured endpoint with additional processing options.
  
  <Info>
  Endpoints provide more flexibility and can include multiple routing targets or transformations.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Webhook Routing (routing.type: 'webhook')">
  Emails are sent directly to a webhook URL via HTTP POST.
  
  <Tip>
  Webhook routing is simpler and more direct for basic email forwarding needs.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="No Routing (routing.type: 'none')">
  Emails are received and stored but not forwarded anywhere.
  
  <Warning>
  Email addresses with no routing cannot forward emails and may not have SES receipt rules configured.
  </Warning>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Status Indicators

- **isActive**: Whether the email address can receive new emails
- **isReceiptRuleConfigured**: Whether AWS SES is properly configured
- **domain.status**: Whether the domain is verified for email receiving

## Important Notes

<Info>
Only email addresses with `isActive: true` and `domain.status: "verified"` can receive emails successfully.
</Info>

<Tip>
Check the `routing` object to understand how emails will be processed and forwarded for this address.
</Tip>

<Warning>
If `isReceiptRuleConfigured` is `false`, the email address may not receive emails properly even if it's active.
</Warning>

## Related Endpoints

- **Update email address**: `PUT /api/v2/email-addresses/{id}`
- **Delete email address**: `DELETE /api/v2/email-addresses/{id}`
- **List all email addresses**: `GET /api/v2/email-addresses`
- **View domain details**: `GET /api/v2/domains/{domainId}`

## Notes

- Email addresses inherit email-receiving capability from their domain's verification status
- The `routing` configuration determines how incoming emails are processed
- SES receipt rules are automatically managed based on the email address configuration
- Both endpoint and webhook routing options provide reliable email delivery
- Email addresses without routing can still receive emails but won't forward them
