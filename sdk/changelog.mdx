# Changelog for Inbound Email SDK

<Update label="January 25, 2025" tags={["SDK", "Major Release", "Unified API"]} rss={{ title: "Unified Email API Release", description: "Unified email API with email.received.* and email.sent.* namespaces" }}>
  ## Unified Email API

  We've introduced a major restructuring of the SDK with a unified email API that consolidates all email operations under `inbound.email.*` with organized namespaces.

  ### üöÄ New Unified Structure

  **Received Email Operations**
  * All inbound email operations moved to `email.received.*`
  * `inbound.email.received.list()` - List received emails
  * `inbound.email.received.get(id)` - Get received email details
  * `inbound.email.received.markRead(id)` - Mark as read
  * `inbound.email.received.archive(id)` - Archive email
  * `inbound.email.received.reply(params)` - Reply to received email

  **Sent Email Operations**
  * Organized sent email operations under `email.sent.*`
  * `inbound.email.sent.get(id)` - Get sent email details
  * `inbound.email.sent.reply(id, params)` - Reply to sent email
  * `inbound.email.sent.listScheduled()` - List scheduled emails
  * `inbound.email.sent.getScheduled(id)` - Get scheduled email
  * `inbound.email.sent.cancel(id)` - Cancel scheduled email

  **Universal Email Access (NEW!)**
  * `inbound.email.get(id)` - Get ANY email (received or sent)
  * Automatically tries received emails first, then sent emails
  * Solves the common "email not found" issue when you don't know the email type

  ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecation Notices

  **mail.* Methods Deprecated**
  * All `inbound.mail.*` methods are deprecated but still work
  * Show console warnings directing to `email.received.*` equivalents
  * Will be removed in a future version

  **Top-level email.* Methods**
  * Some methods moved to organized namespaces
  * `email.listScheduled()` ‚Üí `email.sent.listScheduled()`
  * `email.getScheduled()` ‚Üí `email.sent.getScheduled()`
  * `email.cancel()` ‚Üí `email.sent.cancel()`

  ### ‚ú® Key Benefits

  * **Unified Experience**: One API for all email operations
  * **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript support with specific types
  * **Universal Access**: Get any email without knowing its type
  * **Organized Structure**: Clear separation between received and sent emails
  * **Backward Compatible**: All existing code continues to work

  ### Migration Examples

  ```typescript
  // ‚ùå OLD (deprecated but still works)
  const emails = await inbound.mail.list()
  const email = await inbound.mail.get('email_id')
  
  // ‚úÖ NEW (recommended)
  const emails = await inbound.email.received.list()
  const email = await inbound.email.received.get('email_id')
  
  // üîÑ UNIVERSAL (works for any email type)
  const email = await inbound.email.get('any_email_id')
  ```

  ### Seamless Upgrade

  * Existing code works without changes
  * Console warnings guide migration
  * Documentation updated with examples
  * Migration is optional but recommended
