## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your API Key">
    Sign up at [inbound.new](https://inbound.new) and generate an API key from your dashboard.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install the SDK (Recommended)">
    Install our SDK for the best developer experience:
    
    ```bash
    npm install @inboundemail/sdk
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send Your First Email">
    Start sending emails immediately:
    
    
    ```typescript SDK (typescript)
    import { Inbound } from '@inboundemail/sdk'
    
    const inbound = new Inbound(process.env.INBOUND_API_KEY!)
    
    const { data, error } = await inbound.emails.send({
      from: 'Inbound User <agent@inbnd.dev>',
      to: 'youremail@inbound.new',
      subject: 'Welcome!',
      html: '<p>Thanks for signing up!</p>',
      tags: [{ name: 'campaign', value: 'welcome' }]
    })
    
    console.log(`Email sent: ${data?.id}`)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Inbound Works

Inbound enables you to be able to send & receive emails programmatically.

#### Sending Emails

You can send emails using the SDK or the API. Our SDK is *very* similar to the [Resend SDK](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference). So if you are
migrating from Resend, you shouldn't have any trouble.

Example:

```typescript Node.js
const { data, error } = await inbound.emails.send({
  from: 'Inbound User <agent@inbnd.dev>',
  to: 'youremail@inbound.new',
  subject: 'Welcome!',
  html: '<p>Thanks for signing up!</p>',
  tags: [{ name: 'campaign', value: 'welcome' }]
})

console.log(`Email sent: ${data?.id}`)

// Response:
{
   "id":"nOvWqzU2Geh2q6AfeH1pk", // inbound email id
   "messageId":"010f01990252a2b8-0dcc8a27-a7b4-45be-a290-822f7e509049-000000" // AWS SES Message ID
}
```

#### Receiving Emails

In inbound you can receive emails using endpoints. You can attach endpoints to individual email 
addresses or you can setup catch-all for a domain, where all any incoming email that doesn't match
any of the specific email addresses will be routed to the catch-all endpoint.

Example:

```typescript
switch (email) {
  case 'support@yourdomain.com':
    endpoint1  // Specific endpoint for support
  case 'sales@yourdomain.com':
    endpoint2  // Specific endpoint for sales
  default:    // catch-all
    endpoint3  // Fallback endpoint for all other emails
}
```

## Webhook Payload Structure

We have fully typed webhook payloads for you to use in your endpoints.

```typescript
import type { InboundWebhookPayload } from '@inboundemail/sdk'

const payload: InboundWebhookPayload = {
  event: 'email.received',
  timestamp: '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z',
  email: {
    id: 'email_abc123',
    messageId: '<unique@example.com>',
    from: {
      text: 'John Doe <john@example.com>',
      addresses: [{
        name: 'John Doe',
        address: 'john@example.com'
      }]
    },
    to: {
      text: 'support@yourdomain.com',
      addresses: [{
        name: null,
        address: 'support@yourdomain.com'
      }]
    },
    recipient: 'support@yourdomain.com',
    subject: 'Help with my order',
    receivedAt: '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z',
    parsedData: {
      messageId: '<unique@example.com>',
      date: new Date('2024-01-15T10:30:00Z'),
      subject: 'Help with my order',
      from: {
        text: 'John Doe <john@example.com>',
        addresses: [{
          name: 'John Doe',
          address: 'john@example.com'
        }]
      },
      to: {
        text: 'support@yourdomain.com',
        addresses: [{
          name: null,
          address: 'support@yourdomain.com'
        }]
      },
      cc: null,
      bcc: null,
      replyTo: null,
      inReplyTo: undefined,
      references: undefined,
      textBody: 'Hello, I need help with my recent order...',
      htmlBody: '<p>Hello, I need help with my recent order...</p>',
      attachments: [],
      headers: {},
      priority: undefined
    },
    cleanedContent: {
      html: '<p>Hello, I need help with my recent order...</p>',
      text: 'Hello, I need help with my recent order...',
      hasHtml: true,
      hasText: true,
      attachments: [],
      headers: {}
    }
  },
  endpoint: {
    id: 'endp_xyz789',
    name: 'Support Webhook',
    type: 'webhook'
  }
}
```


## Error Handling

API errors are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or missing API key"
}
```

Common status codes:
- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad Request (invalid parameters)
- `401` - Unauthorized (invalid API key)
- `404` - Not Found (resource not found)
- `500` - Internal Server Error
