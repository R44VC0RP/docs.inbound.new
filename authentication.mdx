# Authentication

All API requests to Inbound v2 require authentication using an API key. This guide explains how to obtain and use your API key securely.

## Base URL

All authenticated requests are made to:

```bash
https://inbound.new/api/v2
```

## Getting Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Dashboard">
    Log in to your Inbound dashboard and navigate to the Settings page.
    
    <Link href="https://inbound.new/settings">Dashboard</Link>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate API Key">
    Click "Create API Key" and give it a descriptive name for easy identification.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy and Store Securely">
    Copy your API key immediately and store it securely. You won't be able to see it again.
    
    <Warning>
    API keys are sensitive credentials. Never expose them in client-side code or commit them to version control.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all API requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
```

## API Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://inbound.new/api/v2/mail \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript JavaScript SDK
import { InboundEmailClient } from '@inboundemail/sdk'

const inbound = new InboundEmailClient(process.env.INBOUND_API_KEY)

// List all emails in mailbox
const { data, error } = await inbound.mail.list()

if (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error)
} else {
  console.log('Emails:', data.emails)
}
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://inbound.new/api/v2/mail',
    headers=headers
)
```
</CodeGroup>

Use API keys for server-to-server communication and automated workflows:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
```

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Environment Variables">
    Always store API keys in environment variables, never in your source code.
    
    ```bash .env
    INBOUND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Key Rotation">
    Regularly rotate your API keys for enhanced security. You can create multiple keys and rotate them without downtime.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Environment Separation">
    Use separate API keys for different environments (development, staging, production) to limit potential exposure.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitoring">
    Monitor your API key usage in the dashboard to detect any unauthorized access.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Testing Authentication

Test your authentication by making a simple request to list emails:



## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or missing API key"
}
```

Common authentication errors:

- **Missing Authorization header**: Include the `Authorization` header in your request
- **Invalid API key format**: Ensure you're using `Bearer your_api_key_here`
- **Expired or revoked key**: Generate a new API key from your dashboard
- **Incorrect key**: Double-check that you're using the correct API key

<Tip>
Test your authentication with the list emails endpoint first. This is a quick way to verify your API key is working correctly.
</Tip>


## Next Steps

Once you have authentication set up, you're ready to start using the Inbound API v2:
