The response headers describe your current rate limit following every request in conformance with the [sixth IETF standard draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers-06):

| Header name           | Description                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ratelimit-limit`     | Maximum number of requests allowed within a window.                 |
| `ratelimit-remaining` | How many requests you have left within the current window.          |
| `ratelimit-reset`     | How many seconds until the limits are reset.                        |
| `retry-after`         | How many seconds you should wait before making a follow-up request. |

## Default Rate Limits

The default maximum rate limit is **2 requests per second** across all API endpoints. This applies uniformly to:

- **Email sending endpoints**: 2 requests per second
- **Email management endpoints**: 2 requests per second 
- **Domain/configuration endpoints**: 2 requests per second
- **All other API endpoints**: 2 requests per second

This number can be increased for trusted senders upon request.

## Rate Limit Response

After exceeding the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response error code:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "message": "Maximum 2 requests per second allowed. Upgrade or contact support for higher limits."
}
```

## Increasing Rate Limits

If you have specific requirements that exceed the default limits, you can request a rate increase:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact Support">
    Reach out to our support team at [support@inbound.new](mailto:support@inbound.new) with your requirements.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Provide Use Case Details">
    Include details about your use case, expected volume, and business requirements.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review and Approval">
    Our team will review your request and work with you to find an appropriate solution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rate Limit by Endpoint


<Warning>
Rate limits are applied per API key. If you're using multiple API keys, each key has its own rate limit bucket.
</Warning>

**Important**: The SDK will return rate limit errors directly - you must handle them in your application code.
